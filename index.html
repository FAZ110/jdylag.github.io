          <h1>DEXTER</h1>
          <p>Dexter is an American crime thriller television series created by James Manos Jr., based on Jeff Lindsay's novel "Darkly Dreaming Dexter."

          <p>Despite his dark urges, Dexter tries to lead a normal life, building relationships and maintaining friendships, but hiding his "dark passenger" becomes increasingly challenging. Over eight seasons, viewers follow his struggles to keep his double life a secret and his inner moral conflicts, which often put his strict personal code to the test.</p>
          <p>Dexter gained widespread popularity and critical acclaim for its unique storyline, intense suspense, and the complexity of its main character. The series was praised for Michael C. Hall's outstanding performance and its unconventional exploration of morality and evil. The show also inspired a revival series, Dexter: New Blood, which explores Dexter’s life many years after the events of the original series.</p></section>
